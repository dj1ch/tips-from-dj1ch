# Tips from [@dj1ch](https://github.com/dj1ch)

### Intro

Coding, especially in a time such as this, can be hard and it can be confusing as where to start. I started coding when I was in elementary school, then carried these skills into my life, and as a high school freshman I apply these skills into my life daily. 

### Tips
1. Start small. Python, Lua, and HTML are good examples of good starting programming languages for beginners.
2. Projects. Don't do stupid things that Social media has told you to do. It's the same shit. Portfolio site, social media app, etc. All of those are wastes of time. Do what you think is an ideal project. Think of it. Plan it out. Release it on github/gitlab, learn to commit and interact with the community, and you will be on the right path.
3. Never give up. It's been said too many times. But don't people give up on their New Year's Resolutions quick?
4. Imposter syndrome is **perfectly normal**. I've experienced it. I'm sure the best of the best have. Terry Davis. Linus Torvalds. Bill Gates. Excellent programmers. I strive to such skill level, but it takes time.
5. People will use you. It's happened before, but it is important to see when it happens. When your work is not properly credited or you just don't **feel** truly valued in that organization. Usually beef/rivalry with other people is a bad enough sign. A community should respect all other partipants and contributors. Leave when you have the chance.
